The Merchant of Venice Speech
Individuals push back and resist society and social expectations of them to various extents, which creates a diversity to how they respond. William Shakespeare’s 1600 comedic play The Merchant of Venice portrays how prejudiced individuals are restricted and made to conform to societal expectations, resulting in diverse responses. David Fincher’s 1999 thriller/drama Fight Club explores the diverse behaviours people develop in response to the enforcement of conformity and the consumerist nature of society.

The Merchant of Venice illustrates how individuals that are restricted and made to conform to societal expectations respond in diverse ways, dependent on their own personal desires. Reflecting the patriarchal structures of Elizabethan England, the play shows Portia struggling against the challenge of her own limited autonomy through the antanaclasis in the lament, “so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father”. The double meaning of her father’s “will'' being a legal document conveys the structural authority which compels her to comply with his dying wishes, in spite of her own. Portia expresses her awareness of the challenge she faces in her metaphorical exclamation that “these naughty times / Put bars between the owners and their rights!” But, rather than resisting this challenge, she embraces her limited autonomy. Hence in the parallel syntax of “One half of me is yours, the other half yours”, she communicates her true desire that Bassanio win her hand in marriage. Although she initially doesn’t resist, when challenged by Antonio’s dire fate she is able to push back against binary gender roles in a way that expresses her diverse range of responses to patriarchal challenges. This is shown through Portia’s imperative that Shylock “Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh”. The patriarchal power structures are reversed as Portia assumes a position of authority and is able to give orders in the courtroom. Therefore, Portia’s changing degree of resistance against patriarchal limitations convey how immediate circumstances can necessitate a diverse array of responses to challenging experiences.

The inconsistencies between Jessica and Shylock’s responses to the challenge of antisemitism reflect how individuals can respond to the same challenge in diverse ways. Jessica responds to the prejudice against Jews by relinquishing her Jewish identity and eloping with a Christian, and the sacrifice she makes to overcome this challenge is expressed in her rhyming couplet “Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost”, which aligns the loss of her family with her own fortunes or desires. Shylock in contrast clings steadfast to his own Jewish identity and responds to the challenge of antisemitism by pursuing revenge against his oppressor Antonio. Shylock thus asserts the necessity of revenge through the religious allusion of his speech “And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn / To have the due and forfeit of my bond”, expressing revenge as something owed to him rather than accepting the legitimacy of Christian antisemitism as his daughter does. Thus, the divide between Shylock and Jessica’s responses reveal the diverse approaches to systemic challenges.

The film Fight Club explores the diverse mechanisms and behaviours people develop in response to the encouragement of conformity to a consumerist mindset in society. The protagonist has a split personality, which is split between the characters of the Narrator and of Tyler Durden. The film opens with a suspenseful eye-level zooming-out shot depicting the Narrator bound and restrained by Tyler Durden, establishing Tyler’s developed position of authority in contrast to the Narrator’s submissive behaviour. The protagonist is a self-proclaimed “slave of consumerism”, and is discontent with his consumerist job as a travelling salesman. The Narrator responds to this challenge by finding emotional relief as an impostor in various support groups, with a montage of close-up shots portraying him hugging and comforting others in distress. In contrast, Tyler responds by pushing back against consumerist and capitalist society by assuming a position of authority over other distressed individuals and developing a Fight Club, with a scene of him fighting such individuals shot in alternation between rotating high angle shots and extreme close ups to accentuate his struggle. The Narrator initially responds to the Fight Club by embracing it, as a close up shot of his figure shows him smirking at the mayhem caused by the club. However, he responds differently once he absorbs the vandalism and harm resulting from the Fight Club, with the film climaxing in a close up of the Narrator disowning his alternate personality, accompanied by a tense score of high pitched strings to starkly contrast their characters. Therefore, the differing responses of the protagonist’s split personas reveals the diverse ways individuals push back against society.

Thus, both The Merchant of Venice and Fight Club explore how individuals respond in diverse ways to perceived challenges as they resist and push back against society to various extents, in order to compel us to critically consider our conventional beliefs and the universality of the human condition.
