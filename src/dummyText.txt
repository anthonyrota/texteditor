PART I — DINNER PARTY
Lewis didn't like crowds. It was already nine o'clock tonight and he had only just managed to get away from the hubbub downstairs, briefly escaping to the childhood bedroom and balcony that had once felt so comforting and familiar. This had always been his favourite place to be. Staring up at the stars which seemed so close, existing on the same expanse of velvety blackness as he did, and each observing silently with the same contemplative stillness the world spinning of its own will beneath them—here, he finally felt at ease. 

As he stood, alone, with the muffled sounds of clinking glasses and chatter and laughter drifting up from below, he already felt so far away as to be in another realm. Looking down to the courtyard at the distant family members who were now beginning to trickle out in small groups, he reached out his fingers and watched as the figures disappeared and re-emerged from behind his outstretched fingertips while they said their goodbyes.

Lewis was a man in a satellite, watching everyone in his life carry out their own goals, studying their little solar systems of human connections and routines from miles and miles away: on this balcony, or in his office, or at home. He would listen but never catch much through the noise, look on but never see much across the distance between him and the world below. He was in space, and the vast expanse of it was somehow suffocating. 

His uncle Jerry was getting into his car, now, and turned to look up. He smiled and waved at Lewis up on his balcony, and mouthed some words of goodbye, but Lewis was too far away to hear them.

Later that night, he snuck away without saying goodbye—a french exit. Although he was tired of floating on his daydreams, coming home only brought him face to face with his own isolation. It had only been a few days, but his house plants had already wilted. He stood there in the dark, watering his plants with his feet still cold from the three-am chill. Avoiding sleep, he looked out his apartment window at the streets below. People walking in and out of buildings, even at this hour. Kissing their hellos and goodbyes. Stepping in puddles, cursing their bad luck. All in orbit, drawn back and forth by the intangible forces of their own lives, while he stood there, directionless. A planet without a sun.

PART II — IN THE CITY
I had my phone out, lost and turning around in circles trying to figure out how to align my Google maps view to the street corner where I was currently standing, stranded and alone. Were you nearby? Should I call you? I hadn't seen you in so long,  and you had disappeared so abruptly after the last family get-together that I was afraid to provoke you in case you ran away again. Afraid that you really would retreat into your own little universe and push us all away.

Even the satellite view wasn't helping me find my bearings, so, defeated, I turned to the nearest stranger and tried my luck. "Excuse me,"—the girl turned and took out an earphone as I began to ask my question—do you know how to get to Ritz street from here? I'm trying to find '——' cafe and I'm completely lost."

She looked at me blankly for a moment, but then a flicker of recognition appeared on her face: "You can't find it because it's hidden away," she said, looking over my shoulder, "but you're basically there already. Straight ahead and turn right at the red sign"—here she pointed to the street behind me, and I could see the faded lettering on a pale red banner hanging from a tattered storefront—"and go through to the other side of the alleyway. It's dark, but it's there."

I thanked her and started in the direction she had pointed me in. Walking in through a beaded curtain to see you sitting at a table in the dingy light, one or two staff shuffling around the place and a cup of coffee in front of you, I sighed a breath of relief. You looked solid, dependable, and like the only thing in the entire establishment that wasn't close to falling apart. My son, my shining star.

REFLECTION
My piece centres on space, stars, and planets as a recurring metaphor for feelings of physical and social isolation, and through this I aimed to evoke empathy for my character's loneliness as well as hope for the possibility for reconnection. My creative choices were influenced by my study of Geraldine Brooks' speech, A Home in Fiction, and Gwen Harwood's poem, Father and Child.

In order to evoke empathy for my character's feelings of loneliness, I introduce my protagonist, Lewis, as aligned with the beauty of the stars, "which seemed so close", using these as a metaphor for his loneliness which frame the feeling as a reflection of a sensitive nature (both he and the stars "observing silently with the same contemplative stillness the world spinning below"), rather than an unfavourable trait. Influenced by Brooks' use of extended metaphors such as the "writer's toolbox", I extend my star metaphor by describing Lewis as "a man in a satellite", thereby evoking a feeling of isolation through the implication of a physical barrier between Lewis and society. By employing a paradox, such that "the vast expanse of [space] was somehow suffocating", I create a complex impression of loneliness as a feeling of simultaneous freedom and constriction, evoking the complexity of that emotion for the audience.

I was further influenced by Harwood's diptych structure, which she uses to emphasise a shift in time as her persona matures, adapting this for my own two part structure which instead emphasises a change in perspective. I use this shift to question Lewis' isolation: as the distant third person introspection is replaced by questions in the first and second person—"Were you nearby? Should I call you?"—the reader feels a sense of care, and connection. The reversal of those initial feelings of loneliness is cemented by the final line of the narrative—"My son, my shining star"—which, by extending again the metaphor of stars, parallels Lewis' self-description as "A planet without a sun" and reverses it, placing him as the sun (homophonically, as a "son", but also literally, as a star) of his parent's universe. In this I was influenced by Harwood's use of charged epithets, such as "angel-mind-old no-sayer" which transforms into "stick-thin comforter"—using the transformative power of such changes to evoke touching feelings of love and warmth, as opposed to Harwood's sense of lost awe as relationships age.

Thus, by employing the central metaphor of stars, I evoke complex feelings of isolation overcome by love, and the possibility of reconnection in the reader, ultimately creating a sense of hope.
